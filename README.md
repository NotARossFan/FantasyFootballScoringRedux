# FantasyFootballScoringRedux

The intent here is to develop an improved Fantasy Football scoring system that will more accurately reflect player performance and bring it in line with
 actual NFL scoring, as if you were actually managing the teams on the field and motivated more by team performance, and less by individual players.

Principles:
- Fantasy Football scores tend to dwarf actual NFL scores with winning teams often scoring 100+ points each week. This should be amended.
- Scoring should be aligned with performance such that "Team Owners" are never cheering against their "Players" teams in the hopes of more points for any individual player.
- A team composed entirely of players from Team A vs. a team entirely composed of players from Team B ought to end with a final score close (or identical) to the actual final score for the week when Team A plays Team B in real life.

Challenges:
TBD
