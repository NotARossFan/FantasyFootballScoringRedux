# FantasyFootballScoringRedux

The intent here is to develop an improved Fantasy Football scoring system that will more accurately reflect player performance and bring it in line with
 actual NFL scoring, as if you were actually managing the teams on the field and motivated more by team performance, and less by individual players.
